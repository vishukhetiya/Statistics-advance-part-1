    "# 1. What is a random variable in probability theory?\n",
    "#### A random variable is a variable that takes on numerical values determined by the outcome of a random phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What are the types of random variables?\n",
    "#### Random variables can be classified into two types: discrete and continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
    "#### Discrete distributions deal with countable outcomes, while continuous distributions deal with uncountable outcomes over an interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
    "#### A probability distribution function (PDF) gives the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
    "#### CDF represents the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value, while PDF represents the density of probabilities at each value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
    "#### A discrete uniform distribution is one in which all outcomes are equally likely over a finite set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
    "#### A Bernoulli distribution models a single trial with two possible outcomes: success (1) or failure (0), with a single parameter p.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n",
    "#### The binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
    "#### The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, often used for rare events.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
    "#### A continuous uniform distribution has constant probability over a given range [a, b].\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",
    "#### The normal distribution is symmetric, bell-shaped, and characterized by its mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",
    "#### The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. It's useful for comparing different data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n",
    "#### The CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean approximates a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
    "#### It explains why many distributions tend to be normal, especially when aggregating many independent effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "#### Z statistics are used to determine how far a data point is from the mean in standard deviations, useful in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n",
    "#### Z = (X - μ) / σ. It shows how many standard deviations a data point is from the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n",
    "#### Point estimates give a single value estimate of a parameter; interval estimates provide a range of values (confidence intervals).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
    "#### They help quantify the uncertainty in a point estimate, giving a likely range for the true population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n",
    "#### A Z-score is used to calculate confidence intervals when population variance is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
    "#### They help standardize and compare values from different normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n",
    "#### The CLT assumes independent samples, a sufficiently large sample size, and identically distributed variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 22. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n",
    "#### Expected value is the weighted average of all possible values that a random variable can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 23. How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n",
    "#### It represents the long-run average result of the random variable over many trials.\n"
